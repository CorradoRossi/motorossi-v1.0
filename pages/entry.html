    <p>Originally written in 1984 (the year I was written as well) Tetris remains one of the most iconic games ever released for the screen. It's a mystery what language Alexey Pazhitnov used to program the alpha however the popular early MS-DOS version was written using PASCAL. Here is a version I made using vanilla Javascript. Use the arrow keys to move and the 'Q' and 'W' keys to rotate. Enjoy!</p>
